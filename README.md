# scaling-solidea

A simple smart contract written in Rust, using Anchor Javascript framework, deployed on Solana blockchain devnet.
 
TODO : 
1. Build a Vue 3 JavaScript SPA client for frontend to interact with the deployed smart contract.
2. Add methods to make RPC calls to the Solana — using Anchor — to fetch and filter events on Solana.
